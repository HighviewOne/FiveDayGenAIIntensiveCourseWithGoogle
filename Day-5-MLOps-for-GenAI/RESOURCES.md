# Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI

## Whitepapers
- MLOps for Generative AI

## Resources
- [Agent Starter Pack](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/agent-starter-pack) - Production-ready templates for GenAI agents on Google Cloud

## Agent Starter Pack Summary

The Agent Starter Pack bridges the gap from prototype to production for GenAI agents. Key features:

- **One-command setup**: `uvx agent-starter-pack create` gets you from zero to deployed
- **Agent templates**: ADK (ReAct), ADK+A2A (distributed), Agentic RAG, LangGraph, Live multimodal
- **CI/CD automation**: Google Cloud Build or GitHub Actions via single command
- **Data pipelines**: Built-in RAG integration with Vertex AI Search and Vector Search
- **Full lifecycle**: Prototyping -> Evaluation -> Deployment (Cloud Run/Agent Engine) -> Monitoring
- **Remote templates**: Share custom agent templates from any Git repo

Requirements: Python 3.10+, Google Cloud SDK, Terraform, Make
